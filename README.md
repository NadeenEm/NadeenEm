# 👋 Hi there, Nadeen here :)

Welcome to my GitHub space 🌱  
Here you'll find a mix of projects at the intersection of **economics**, **data science**, and a few fun creative twists.

---

I currently work as an **economics researcher** and have a deep passion for **data**, especially when it comes to uncovering insights and telling stories with it. Alongside my PhD in Economics — where I explore how central banks communicate and act on climate change — I also pursued a **Diploma in Data Science**.

Through that journey, I got hands-on experience with:
- **Python**
- **Machine Learning models**
- **Airflow**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Pandas & Scikit-learn**
- **Text Mining**
- and even a bit of neural networks and audio analysis 🎧

## ✨ Projects

From what I've learned during my PhD and data studies, here are a few projects I'd love to share:

| 🧩 Project | ⚙️ What It’s About | 🧰 Tools |
|-----------|--------------------|---------|
| **FinTech Data Pipeline** | A full ETL pipeline to clean, transform, and load loan data using Airflow | Python, Airflow, PostgreSQL, Pandas |
| **Billboard Music Trends**| Exploring the evolution of genres, moods, and artist trends across decades | Python, Spotify API, Seaborn |
| **Central Banks & Climate: NLP**| Analyzing how central banks talk about climate change using speech data | Python, NLP, Topic Modeling |

## 💡 Interests & Goals

While my main research focus is in **economic data**, I'm also curious and excited about:
- 🧠 **Text mining**, especially analyzing policy, academic, or speech content
- 🎶 **Music analytics**, from trends to lyrics to sounds
- 🤝 Collaborating on data-driven projects that make insights accessible and impactful

I’d love to keep expanding this repository with more useful (and fun!) projects and research — so I look forward to colaborations 🚀
